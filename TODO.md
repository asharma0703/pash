- working on all tests
- fix details in shortest_scripts.sh and tr-test.sh
- clean up utils for annotations
- graphviz
- Changing PaSh flags (making the default be priority r-split and then consecutive chunks), so remove the r_split flag and make defaults be the ones from the OSDI paper
- Fixing annotation library installation to a specific commit
- Remove code which got obsolete due to the changes
